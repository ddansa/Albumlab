TODO
/home/index:
	Add Band description prop (Can be "static" text set in Band constructor)
	Add <a> href to band <li> that links to the albums of the band.

/albums/index/{band-id}:
	Create view
		/index/{band-id} Should take in id of band and display their albums.
			No need for "data linking", data is hard-coded so just new up a DataManager in the controller
				private static DataManager _data = new DataManager(); for example.

				reach the band data by doing something like
				Band band = _data.GetBandById({band-id}); (gives you the Band with {band-id})

	Optional: Fallback if url contains no ID?

Optional:
/albums/details/?bandId={band-id}&albumId={album-id}
	Add view to display detail for the album. (inside AlbumController)
	Add method GetAlbumById to Band class

	AlbumController method for details should be something like
	    public IActionResult Index(int bandId, int albumId) { }

	Albums in View /albums/index/{band-id} should have a link to /albums/details/?bandId={band-id}&albumId={album-id}
